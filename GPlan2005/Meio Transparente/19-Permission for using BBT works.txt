  Permission for using BBT works



  We strongly believe in “fair use.” So if all you want to do is make fair-use
  quotations, please feel free. We love to be quoted.

  Are you a student or teacher? Want to make incidental use of a BBT work in the
  course of your studies or teaching? An image, perhaps. Or a page or so of text.
  By all means, just feel free.

  Again if you’re a student or teacher and you want to publish an occasional BBT
  image on your website in an academic context, be our guest. Just please add our
  copyright notice:

          Bhaktivedanta Book Trust
          International, Inc.
          www.krishna.com

  And in your notice, please make www.krishna.com a link.


   For other uses, we ask you to first get our permission.

  · Want to use BBT images outside an academic context?

  · Or in a book or periodical?

  · Want to publish passages that go beyond fair use?

  · Or use BBT sounds, images, or text for something you’re going to sell?

  Please get in touch with us.

  Very often, all we’ll ask is a simple copyright notice. If you’re selling something,
  we may ask a very reasonable fee.

  Our contact info is at the top of this page. Or you can fill in our online request for
  permission.
