Dedication

I dedicate this work to all the servants of the Lord, especially the Vaishnava devotees, of which the most dear is  to my initiating spiritual master, His Holiness Hridayananda Dasa Goswami Maharaj (1), one afternoon in May 1991 kindly accepted me as his disciple, and without the aid of which remain shrouded in the darkness of material consciousness, in search of false hopes brought about by selfish philosophies and practices.

Note 1:
SS Hridayananda dasa Goswami Maharaj (Dr. Howard J. Resnick), is one of the most prominent spiritual leaders of the International Society of Krishna Consciousness - ISKCON.



Presentation

This work aims to facilitate the development by Vaishnava devotees (1) of a printed book with the following characteristics:

- Weekly planner;

- Monthly planner;

- Custom;

- That facilitates the planning and control of the results of activities, and not only the running time;

- That includes the information related to festivals, events and fasts of Vaishnava calendar, generated by the "GCAL - Gaurabda Calendar" (2);

- That shows quotes (3) of the Vedic texts (4), including Sanskrit (5) facilitating meditation, study and memorizing the teachings of acharyas (6).

- That shows information to the other common planners (7) and schedules.

We will feel successful in our intention if at least one servant of the Lord has found more ease in implementing your service by using this document.
