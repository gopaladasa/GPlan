                  ABOUT THE BHAKTIVEDANTA BOOK TRUST


The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust (BBT) is the publishing house
established by His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada
to publish his works, as well as other writings. Since its founding
in 1972, it has become the world's largest publisher of India's vast
