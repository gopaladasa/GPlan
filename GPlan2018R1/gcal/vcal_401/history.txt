VCAL Version 4.01 - Released June 9, 1999
=========================================

The town file, vcal.tow, released with version 4.00 was
corrupted. In this version (4.01) a new format of the town file
was introduced with a version number. Now the program does not
accept older versions of the town file. This was done to make
sure that the user of version 4.01 will not by mistake use the
old corrupted town file.

If the new town file is used with an erlier version of the
program then an error will be indicated.

The version number of the program is now written on each calendar
to make it clear which program produced the calendar.



VCAL Version 4.00 - Released Mars 2, 1999

This is the first public version.
